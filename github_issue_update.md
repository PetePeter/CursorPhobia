## Implementation Phases Added

I've completed the analysis and created a detailed 4-phase implementation plan for this work item. The phases break down the complex Windows API wrapper implementation into manageable increments:

### Phase Breakdown:
1. **Phase 1: Core Windows API Foundation** (1-2 weeks, Medium complexity)
   - Basic Windows API P/Invoke wrapper infrastructure
   - Always-on-top window detection system
   - Foundation for all subsequent phases

2. **Phase 2: Global Mouse Tracking and Basic Avoidance** (2-3 weeks, High complexity)
   - Global low-level mouse hook implementation
   - Proximity detection and basic window pushing
   - Multi-monitor support foundation

3. **Phase 3: Advanced Timing Logic and Enhanced Features** (2-3 weeks, High complexity)
   - CTRL key override functionality
   - 5-second hover timer implementation
   - Edge wrapping and monitor teleportation

4. **Phase 4: User Interface and Configuration System** (1-2 weeks, Medium complexity)
   - System tray integration with context menu
   - Configuration dialog and settings management
   - JSON-based settings persistence

### Key Features:
✅ **Incremental Value**: Each phase delivers testable functionality that builds on the previous
✅ **Clear Dependencies**: Logical progression from foundation to advanced features
✅ **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit, integration, and manual testing strategies for each phase
✅ **Specific Deliverables**: Exact files, classes, and functions to implement

**Total Timeline**: 6-10 weeks

Full detailed plan with file structure, acceptance criteria, and testing strategies is available in the repository at `PHASED_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.

Ready to begin Phase 1 implementation.
