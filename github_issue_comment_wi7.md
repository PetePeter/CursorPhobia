# WI#7 Multi-Monitor Support - Phased Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines a 4-phase implementation plan to address the critical missing features in WI#3 Multi-Monitor Support. The plan prioritizes operational blockers while building foundational infrastructure for comprehensive multi-monitor support.

**Total Estimated Effort:** 6-9 development days  
**Risk Reduction:** MEDIUM-HIGH → LOW after completion

## Priority Assessment
Based on stakeholder feedback:
1. **Priority 1:** DPI Scaling Support (operational blocker)
2. **Priority 2:** MockMonitorManager (testing blocker) 
3. **Priority 3:** Monitor Hotplug Detection (operational blocker)
4. **Priority 4:** Thread Safety & Per-Monitor Config (stability)

## Phase 1: DPI Foundation & Testing Infrastructure
**Duration:** 2-3 days | **Risk:** LOW | **Dependencies:** None

### Objectives
- Implement DPI awareness APIs and core infrastructure
- Create MockMonitorManager for comprehensive testing
- Establish foundation for all subsequent monitor operations

### Key Deliverables
- Windows DPI APIs (`GetDpiForMonitor`, `SetProcessDpiAwareness`)
- `DpiInfo` model with scale factors and conversion utilities
- `IMonitorManager` interface + `MockMonitorManager` implementation
- DPI-aware coordinate conversion utilities
- Comprehensive unit tests for DPI operations

### Success Criteria
✅ All existing monitor tests pass with new interface  
✅ DPI coordinate conversions accurate within 1 pixel  
✅ MockMonitorManager supports complex scenarios  
✅ Code coverage ≥ 80% for monitor operations

## Phase 2: Monitor Hotplug Detection
**Duration:** 1-2 days | **Risk:** LOW-MEDIUM | **Dependencies:** Phase 1

### Objectives
- Implement real-time monitor configuration change detection
- Enable automatic adaptation to display changes without restart
- Integrate with existing configuration system

### Key Deliverables
- `WM_DISPLAYCHANGE` message handling
- `MonitorConfigurationWatcher` service with event notifications
- `MonitorChangeEventArgs` for change details
- Automatic cache invalidation on monitor changes
- Per-monitor settings migration during topology changes

### Success Criteria
✅ Monitor changes detected within 500ms  
✅ Existing functionality unaffected during changes  
✅ Per-monitor settings migrate properly  
✅ No memory leaks from event subscriptions

---

## Phase 3: Per-Monitor Configuration Integration
**Duration:** 2-3 days | **Risk:** MEDIUM | **Dependencies:** Phase 1 + 2

### Objectives
- Fully integrate per-monitor settings with core engine
- Implement DPI-aware proximity calculations
- Enable monitor-specific behavior customization

### Key Deliverables
- `CursorPhobiaEngine` updated for per-monitor settings
- DPI-aware proximity calculations (logical ↔ physical pixels)
- Enhanced `SettingsForm` with per-monitor configuration UI
- Monitor identification and visual layout representation
- Updated core services (`ProximityDetector`, `WindowPusher`, `EdgeWrapHandler`)

### Success Criteria
✅ Different proximity thresholds work per monitor  
✅ Consistent behavior across mixed-DPI setups  
✅ Settings persist through hotplug events  
✅ UI accurately reflects monitor configuration

## Phase 4: Thread Safety & Production Hardening
**Duration:** 1-2 days | **Risk:** LOW | **Dependencies:** Phase 3

### Objectives
- Resolve thread safety issues in monitor caching
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Achieve production-ready stability and performance

### Key Deliverables
- Reader-writer locks for `MonitorManager` cache operations
- Thread-safe monitor enumeration and cache updates
- Comprehensive error handling for DPI/monitor API failures
- Performance optimization and metrics collection
- 24-hour stability testing validation

### Success Criteria
✅ No race conditions under concurrent load  
✅ Graceful handling of all error conditions  
✅ Performance impact ≤ 5% vs single-monitor  
✅ Memory usage stable during extended operation

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Approach
- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementation
- **Interface-First Design**: Define interfaces before concrete implementations  
- **Incremental Integration**: Each phase builds on previous foundations
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain existing single-monitor functionality

### Quality Gates
- **Code Coverage:** ≥ 80% for all new code
- **Performance:** No regression in single-monitor scenarios
- **Stability:** Pass 24-hour stress tests
- **Compatibility:** Support Windows 10/11, multiple DPI scales

### Risk Mitigation
- **Phase 1** establishes testing infrastructure early
- **MockMonitorManager** enables comprehensive testing without hardware
- **Incremental delivery** allows early validation and feedback
- **Comprehensive logging** enables production troubleshooting

---

## Phase Dependencies

```
Phase 1 (DPI + Testing)
    ↓
Phase 2 (Hotplug Detection)
    ↓  
Phase 3 (Configuration Integration)
    ↓
Phase 4 (Thread Safety + Hardening)
```

Each phase can be independently tested and delivered, enabling iterative development and early value delivery.

## Next Steps

The complete implementation plan has been documented in `X:\coding\CursorPhobia\WI7_PHASED_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.

This plan addresses all critical issues identified in the technical debt analysis:

✅ **DPI Scaling Support** - Phase 1 priority implementation  
✅ **MockMonitorManager** - Phase 1 for comprehensive testing  
✅ **Monitor Hotplug Detection** - Phase 2 event-driven implementation  
✅ **Per-Monitor Configuration** - Phase 3 full integration  
✅ **Thread Safety Issues** - Phase 4 production hardening  

**Ready to begin Phase 1 implementation upon approval.**

The phased approach ensures:
- **Early value delivery** with each completed phase
- **Reduced risk** through incremental, testable implementation
- **Comprehensive testing** enabled by MockMonitorManager from Phase 1
- **Production readiness** achieved through systematic hardening

This plan transforms the MEDIUM-HIGH risk technical debt into a LOW risk, systematic implementation roadmap.
