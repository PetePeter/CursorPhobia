## Summary

This issue addresses the **missing production readiness features** that were originally specified in GitHub Issue #6 but were not implemented. Issue #6 was closed after implementing valuable test infrastructure fixes, but the core production readiness requirements remain unaddressed.

## Gap Analysis: Issue #6 Implementation vs Requirements

### ‚ùå What Issue #6 Originally Required (MISSING)
- **Single Instance Management** - Prevent multiple app copies running
- **Application Lifecycle Management** - Graceful startup/shutdown sequences  
- **Standard Logging Framework** - Replace custom logging with log4net
- **Global Exception Handling** - Prevent crashes with recovery mechanisms
- **Build Automation** - Single portable executable with build script
- **Error Recovery** - Hook recovery and configuration reset capabilities

### ‚úÖ What Was Actually Implemented in Issue #6 (COMPLETED)
- Fixed WindowPusher test compilation errors (33 tests now passing)
- Created MockWindowDetectionService for comprehensive test infrastructure
- Updated constructor parameter order after EdgeWrapHandler integration
- Restored development workflow and test coverage

### üìä Requirements Fulfillment Rate
- **Original Issue #6 Production Features:** 0% implemented
- **Test Infrastructure Work:** 100% completed (different scope)
- **Remaining Work for Production Readiness:** All core features still needed

## Current State Analysis

### What Works Well ‚úÖ
- **Test Infrastructure:** Robust mock services and comprehensive test coverage
- **Core Functionality:** Window detection, pushing, and edge wrapping working
- **EdgeWrapHandler Integration:** Successfully integrated with proper testing
- **Development Workflow:** Fully unblocked with passing tests

### What's Missing for Production ‚ùå
- **No Single Instance Protection** - Multiple CursorPhobia instances can run simultaneously
- **No Application Lifecycle Management** - No graceful startup/shutdown sequences
- **Custom Logging Only** - Still using basic TestLogger instead of industry-standard framework
- **No Global Exception Handling** - Unhandled exceptions can crash the application
- **Manual Build Process** - No automated build script or single-file deployment
- **No Error Recovery** - Hook failures require manual intervention

## Requirements for Production Readiness

### 1. Single Instance Management
**Current Gap:** Application allows multiple instances to run simultaneously

**Required Implementation:**
- [ ] Implement `SingleInstanceManager` class in `src/Core/Services/`
- [ ] Use named mutex to prevent multiple instances
- [ ] Handle activation of existing instance when second launch attempted
- [ ] Proper cleanup of instance locks on application shutdown
- [ ] Cross-user session handling

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Only one CursorPhobia instance can run per user session
- Second launch attempts bring existing instance to foreground
- Clean mutex cleanup on application exit

### 2. Application Lifecycle Management  
**Current Gap:** No structured startup/shutdown process

**Required Implementation:**
- [ ] Create `ApplicationLifecycleManager` class implementing `IApplicationLifecycleManager`
- [ ] Implement `IHostedService` pattern for service management
- [ ] Graceful startup sequence with dependency initialization order
- [ ] Graceful shutdown with proper resource cleanup
- [ ] Handle Windows shutdown/logoff events
- [ ] Ensure all system hooks removed on exit

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Services start in correct dependency order
- All system hooks properly removed on shutdown
- Application responds to Windows shutdown events
- No resource leaks or orphaned processes

### 3. Standard Logging Framework Integration
**Current Gap:** Using basic custom logging instead of industry standard

**Required Implementation:**
- [ ] Replace `TestLogger`/`Logger` classes with log4net integration
- [ ] Implement `Log4NetLogger` class implementing existing `ILogger` interface
- [ ] Configure structured logging with proper log levels (Debug, Info, Warn, Error)
- [ ] File-based logging with automatic rotation (max 10MB, 5 files)
- [ ] Performance logging for critical window operations
- [ ] Thread-safe logging across all services

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All existing logging calls work without modification
- Log files created in `%APPDATA%/CursorPhobia/Logs/`
- Automatic log rotation prevents disk space issues
- Performance metrics logged for window push operations

### 4. Global Exception Handling
**Current Gap:** Unhandled exceptions can crash the application

**Required Implementation:**
- [ ] Implement `GlobalExceptionHandler` class
- [ ] Register for `AppDomain.UnhandledException` and `Application.ThreadException`
- [ ] Catch and log unhandled exceptions at application level
- [ ] Implement graceful degradation when non-critical services fail
- [ ] User-friendly error messages for recoverable failures
- [ ] Automatic recovery mechanisms for hook failures

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Application continues running after non-critical component failures
- All exceptions logged with full stack traces
- Users receive meaningful error messages, not technical exceptions
- Hook failures trigger automatic recovery attempts

### 5. Build Automation
**Current Gap:** Manual build process, no single-file deployment

**Required Implementation:**
- [ ] Create `BuildScript.bat` for automated build process
- [ ] Implement single-file executable generation using .NET publish
- [ ] Proper versioning with build metadata (version, date, commit hash)
- [ ] Automated testing integration in build process
- [ ] Release packaging with all dependencies included

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- `BuildScript.bat` produces working single-file executable
- No external dependencies required for deployment
- Version information visible in executable properties
- Build script runs all tests and fails if any test fails

### 6. Error Recovery Mechanisms
**Current Gap:** System failures require manual intervention

**Required Implementation:**
- [ ] Implement hook recovery when `SetWindowsHookEx` fails
- [ ] Configuration reset capabilities for corrupted settings files
- [ ] Service restart mechanisms for critical component failures
- [ ] Diagnostic information gathering for troubleshooting
- [ ] Health check system for monitoring service status

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System hook failures automatically recovered within 5 seconds
- Corrupted configuration files reset to defaults with user notification
- Failed services automatically restart up to 3 times
- Debug mode available for detailed diagnostic information
