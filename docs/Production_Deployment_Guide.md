## Deployment Methods

### Method 1: Single-File Executable Deployment (Recommended)

#### Download and Verification
1. **Obtain Latest Release**:
   ```
   Download: CursorPhobia-v{version}-win-x64.exe
   Verify:   Check file properties for version information
   Size:     Approximately 15-25MB (self-contained)
   ```

2. **Digital Signature Verification** (if code signing is enabled):
   ```powershell
   Get-AuthenticodeSignature -FilePath "CursorPhobia-v{version}-win-x64.exe"
   ```

#### Installation Steps
1. **Create Application Directory**:
   ```
   Recommended: C:\Program Files\CursorPhobia\
   Alternative: C:\Users\{Username}\AppData\Local\CursorPhobia\
   ```

2. **Copy Executable**:
   ```
   Copy CursorPhobia-v{version}-win-x64.exe to installation directory
   Rename to: CursorPhobia.exe (optional, for consistency)
   ```

3. **Create Desktop Shortcut** (optional):
   ```
   Target: C:\Program Files\CursorPhobia\CursorPhobia.exe
   Start in: C:\Program Files\CursorPhobia\
   ```

4. **First Launch Verification**:
   ```
   Run executable to verify successful initialization
   Check system tray for CursorPhobia icon
   Verify log directory creation: %APPDATA%\CursorPhobia\Logs\
   ```

### Method 2: MSI Package Deployment (Future Enhancement)
*Note: MSI package creation is planned for future releases. Current deployment uses single-file executable.*

### Method 3: Enterprise Group Policy Deployment

#### For Domain Environments
1. **Package Preparation**:
   ```
   Create network share: \\domain\shares\software\CursorPhobia\
   Copy executable and deployment scripts
   Set appropriate permissions (Domain Users: Read & Execute)
   ```

2. **Group Policy Computer Configuration**:
   ```
   Computer Configuration > Policies > Software Settings > Software Installation
   Add new package: \\domain\shares\software\CursorPhobia\CursorPhobia.exe
   Deployment Method: Assigned (for automatic installation)
   ```

3. **Startup Script Configuration**:
   ```batch
   @echo off
   if not exist "C:\Program Files\CursorPhobia\CursorPhobia.exe" (
       xcopy "\\domain\shares\software\CursorPhobia\*" "C:\Program Files\CursorPhobia\" /Y /Q
   )
   ```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Single Instance Issues
**Problem**: Multiple instances running simultaneously
```
Solution:
1. Check for orphaned mutex handles: Process Explorer > Find Handle "CursorPhobia"
2. Restart Windows to clear system resources
3. Verify user account permissions for Global\ namespace access
```

**Problem**: Second launch doesn't activate first instance
```
Solution:
1. Check Windows Firewall blocking named pipe communication
2. Verify %TEMP% directory permissions for named pipe creation
3. Check antivirus real-time protection interfering with inter-process communication
```

#### Exception Handling Issues
**Problem**: Application crashes without error handling
```
Solution:
1. Check Event Viewer: Windows Logs > Application for .NET Runtime errors
2. Review log files for GlobalExceptionHandler initialization
3. Verify Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable installation (if not self-contained)
```

#### Logging Issues
**Problem**: Log files not created or rotation not working
```
Solution:
1. Verify %APPDATA%\CursorPhobia\ directory permissions
2. Check disk space availability (>100MB recommended)
3. Review NLog configuration in NLog.config for syntax errors
```

**Problem**: Performance degradation with excessive logging
```
Solution:
1. Adjust log level in configuration: "Warning" or "Error" only
2. Reduce log file retention: maxLogFiles from 5 to 2
3. Monitor disk I/O performance during high-activity periods
```

#### Error Recovery Issues
**Problem**: Windows hook failures not recovering automatically
```
Solution:
1. Check User Account Control (UAC) settings - may require elevated privileges
2. Verify Windows API compatibility with current Windows version
3. Review ErrorRecoveryManager logs for circuit breaker status
```

## Security Considerations

### Application Security
- **Code Signing**: Verify digital signatures when available
- **Privilege Requirements**: Runs with standard user privileges (no elevation required)
- **Network Communication**: No inbound connections, minimal outbound requirements
- **Data Protection**: Configuration files contain no sensitive information

### Enterprise Security
- **Group Policy**: Compatible with standard enterprise Group Policy deployment
- **Antivirus Compatibility**: Tested with major antivirus solutions
- **Application Whitelisting**: Supports code signing for application whitelisting policies
- **Audit Logging**: All security-relevant events logged for compliance

### Privacy Considerations
- **Data Collection**: No telemetry or personal data collection
- **Log Content**: Logs contain system information only (no user data)
- **Network Traffic**: No automatic network communication or update checks
- **Configuration**: All settings stored locally, no cloud synchronization

## Performance Optimization

### Resource Usage Optimization
```
Memory Footprint: Typically 25-50MB working set
CPU Usage: <1% during normal operation, brief spikes during cursor events
Disk I/O: Minimal except during log rotation
Network: None during normal operation
```

### Performance Tuning Options
1. **Logging Level Adjustment**:
   ```json
   "loggingSettings": {
     "logLevel": "Warning"  // Reduces log volume
   }
   ```

2. **Error Recovery Tuning**:
   ```json
   "errorRecoverySettings": {
     "maxRetryAttempts": 1,  // Faster failure detection
     "retryDelayMs": 500     // Reduced recovery delay
   }
   ```

3. **Health Check Intervals**:
   ```json
   "healthCheckSettings": {
     "checkIntervalMs": 30000  // Less frequent health checks
   }
   ```
